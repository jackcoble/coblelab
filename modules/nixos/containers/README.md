# containers

The `containers` module contains all the containerised services I want to run via Podman.

Below is a table of all the applications that I have containerised.

| Application      | Purpose                                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| UniFi Controller | Network management for my APs and Switch |
